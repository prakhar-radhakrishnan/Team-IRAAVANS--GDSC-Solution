HUNGO
HUNGO is an app developed to help users analyze their buffer calories (food) intake and advise them to replace those extra calories with healthier options. Our mission is to "save a bread" for a "NEEDY". We are aiming to use Google Vision to analyze the calories and buffer nutrients in the food. We also provide users with HUNGO rewards, which encourage them to donate good quality food and get quality checks done to gain more rewards that can be further redeemed.

Tech Stack
HUNGO is developed using Python and Django on the backend and HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap on the frontend. We also use APIs and asgi_application to support our app's functionalities.
